Oliver Haynes's Project 1

Description of additional functionality:
	1. Lots of animations added to elements, many of which are dynamically generated.
	2. Incorporated a Wiki Query callout using the user's ultimate selection from dynamic selects. Results are displayed with a link to continue reading article if so desired.
	3. Incorporated a Youtube video link gathered from another callout using dynamic select result.
	4. Added a loading transition screen - page is only displayed once all DOM elements are fully loaded.
